A sample blog page that demonstrates how to integrate social media content.

# Social Media Integration

This post shows how you can integrate various social media platforms into your Jekyll blog.

## Twitter Integration

Twitter integration can be achieved using the jekyll-twitter-plugin. However, this functionality has been disabled for GitHub Pages compatibility.

## Alternative Approaches

For GitHub Pages compatibility, consider using:
- Embedded tweets via iframe
- Screenshots with links
- Manual embedding of tweet content

## Additional Details

For more details on using the plugin visit: [jekyll-twitter-plugin](https://github.com/rob-murray/jekyll-twitter-plugin)

**Note:** Advanced social media integration features have been disabled for GitHub Pages compatibility to ensure the site builds successfully.
